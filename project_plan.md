# Cloud-Based Agricultural Platform (Karnataka Region)

## Objective
To build a cloud-based web application to assist farmers in Karnataka in making informed decisions using Machine Learning.

---

## Features and Implementation Plan

### 1. Crop Price Prediction
#### **Input:**
- Dropdown for Crop Name
- Dropdown for Region

#### **Output:**
- Graph (via Matplotlib) displaying predicted prices

#### **Backend:**
- Use a trained scikit-learn regression model.
- Load historical crop price data from CSV.
- Train a model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor) to predict future prices.

#### **Frontend:**
- Form with dropdowns for crop selection and region.
- Display prediction graph using Flask's `render_template` and embed Matplotlib visualizations.

#### **Steps:**
1. Create a CSV dataset with historical crop price data filtered by region.
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize, etc.).
3. Develop and train the regression model in Python using scikit-learn.
4. Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
5. Build Flask API to accept user input and return price predictions.
6. Render the prediction graph in the frontend.

### 2. Crop Recommendation
#### **Input:**
- Dropdown for Region
- Dropdown for Soil Type
- Numeric input for Land Size

#### **Output:**
- Table with recommended crops and additional info:
  - Expected Return
  - Demand Score

#### **Backend:**
- Use a trained ML model (e.g., Decision Tree or Random Forest Classifier).
- Train on a dataset containing regional data, crop profitability, soil type compatibility, and price trends.

#### **Frontend:**
- Form with dropdowns for the region and soil type, and an input field for land size.
- Display a table of recommended crops with relevant info.

#### **Steps:**
1. Gather a dataset with crop profitability, soil compatibility, and demand scores.
2. Preprocess the dataset and train the recommendation model.
3. Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.
4. Build Flask API to provide recommendations based on user input.
5. Render the recommendations table in the frontend.

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly UI.
- Use dropdowns for ease of use.

### **Backend**
- Flask for API creation and routing.

### **Machine Learning**
- scikit-learn for building and training ML models.
- Use joblib or pickle for model serialization.

### **Deployment**
- Deploy the application on Render (or similar cloud platforms like Heroku).
- Ensure the models and static files (CSS, JS) are accessible on the cloud.

## Data Requirements
- Historical crop price data for Karnataka.
- Regional data for soil type compatibility, crop profitability, and market demand.

---

## Steps to Build

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect or create CSV datasets for historical crop prices and crop recommendations.
   - Ensure the data is cleaned and preprocessed.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Develop separate ML models for price prediction and crop recommendation.
   - Test and evaluate models for accuracy.

3. **Backend Development:**
   - Build Flask APIs to:
     - Predict crop prices based on user inputs.
     - Provide crop recommendations based on inputs.

4. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create HTML templates using Bootstrap for a clean interface.
   - Use dropdowns for inputs and display outputs dynamically.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the Flask application on Render.
   - Test the deployed app for functionality and performance.

## Deployment Notes
1. Use Render's free tier for deployment.
2. Set up environment variables for sensitive configurations (if any).
3. Ensure that the Flask app is production-ready (use `gunicorn`).

## Future Enhancements
- Add multilingual support for the interface (e.g., Kannada).
- Include weather-based crop recommendations.
- Incorporate real-time data sources for dynamic predictions.
